# Snap

Repo Archived. New version is written in Node.js: https://github.com/executebig/snaps

Medium's "Claps", but self-hosted as-a-service. Code is not factored well... made at a hackathon. Will update in the coming weeks!

# API
Send snaps to the `/snaps` endpoints and get the number of snaps for an article from `/get_snaps`. Send data with post requests.
